I‚Äôm older now, and have been researching different oils that are best when it comes to aging and general moisturizing. I‚Äôm happy to find that Sephora carries the small size of Phoenix. First, there are only a few ingredients, and all are proven in my experience to be effective. Sea Buckthorn oil is divine, it grows in northern climes and is used as traditional medicine in Siberia, where it will quickly heal burns and frostbite. (rivalled only by bear grease in that capacity, but you have to have found bear roadkill to source it). Straight Sea buckthorn oil is available (The ordinary sells an inexpensive version) but it stains your skin a nicotine colour so...not ideal. When mixed with other ingredients it‚Äôs staining qualities are no longer an issue. Meadowfoam oil is the other star ingredient IMO. This oil is so lovely and yet very hard to find. Fresh used to use it a lot, it was in their excellent soy cream that you can‚Äôt get anymore, that‚Äôs how I discovered it. So if it is so great why buy the small size, given that buying bigger is cheaper per milliliter? Because oil is somewhat unstable and once opened it starts to oxidise and having noticed either a markedly rapid loss of the oil product‚Äôs smell (or worse, a rancid smell) I just feel like it‚Äôs better to use smaller quantities to preserve the integrity of the product. Herbivore have been around awhile, and this oil was one of the original products. When I first discovered them I got the LApis oil (very good) and the facial spray (ditto). I was and still am impressed by the high quality and minimal ingredients. Herbivore has somewhat deviated from this with the newer products, no shade to them but so many have over 20 ingredients now, which is fine I guess but I prefer my skincare (oil especially) to err on the side of simplicity.

If you need hydration, put a light gel-moisturizer on, let it soak in, and put this on top of it.  This stuff is very thick and it will lock in hydration, but if you‚Äôre applying it onto dry skin without adding hydration first, you might not get the results you‚Äôre looking for.  #2 - This is my go to for winter months but it‚Äôs a bit heavy for summer months.  You might want to find something lighter if you‚Äôre looking for something to use year round.  I use this product *as needed*.  I‚Äôm more likely to use it at night because it‚Äôs just so thick.  #3 - There is some mild fragrance here, so if that‚Äôs not your jam, look elsewhere.  #4 - This product is very expensive, and there are cheaper alternatives on the market.  With that said, I am going to be repurchasing this product as soon as my container is completely used up.  I really liked the product that much.

I‚Äôm older now, and have been researching different oils that are best when it comes to aging and general moisturizing. I‚Äôm happy to find that Sephora carries the small size of Phoenix. First, there are only a few ingredients, and all are proven in my experience to be effective. Sea Buckthorn oil is divine, it grows in northern climes and is used as traditional medicine in Siberia, where it will quickly heal burns and frostbite. (rivalled only by bear grease in that capacity, but you have to have found bear roadkill to source it). Straight Sea buckthorn oil is available (The ordinary sells an inexpensive version) but it stains your skin a nicotine colour so...not ideal. When mixed with other ingredients it‚Äôs staining qualities are no longer an issue. Meadowfoam oil is the other star ingredient IMO. This oil is so lovely and yet very hard to find. Fresh used to use it a lot, it was in their excellent soy cream that you can‚Äôt get anymore, that‚Äôs how I discovered it. So if it is so great why buy the small size, given that buying bigger is cheaper per milliliter? Because oil is somewhat unstable and once opened it starts to oxidise and having noticed either a markedly rapid loss of the oil product‚Äôs smell (or worse, a rancid smell) I just feel like it‚Äôs better to use smaller quantities to preserve the integrity of the product. Herbivore have been around awhile, and this oil was one of the original products. When I first discovered them I got the LApis oil (very good) and the facial spray (ditto). I was and still am impressed by the high quality and minimal ingredients. Herbivore has somewhat deviated from this with the newer products, no shade to them but so many have over 20 ingredients now, which is fine I guess but I prefer my skincare (oil especially) to err on the side of simplicity.

I thankfully did not have a white cast with this sunscreen, after thorough application, but it definitely gives a very shiny finish. I really like the squalane, which is very moisturizing and (for me at least) noncomedogenic. In winter, it seals my moisturizer well, doesn‚Äôt just sit on top of skin, and protects my skin not only from sun but from harsh, drying wind. Even when my skin is more sensitive, it doesn‚Äôt create any noticeable irritation, just a bit of tingling when I first apply. I like zinc as an active (especially since it uses a good percentage of it), and it stays on well even though it‚Äôs so spreadable. I‚Äôve never had any issues with it irritating my eyes or migrating on my skin, even though I apply on the orbital bone. The only negatives: at SPF 30 and PA+++, I know I‚Äôm getting the appropriate protection in both UVB and UVA, but only in winter/late fall/early spring when the UV index isn‚Äôt too high. It is not enough for summer, especially since I am a bit photosensitive, and I‚Äôve burned before even with reapplication. However, I‚Äôve never had any issues with UV index of 6 or less, so it really just depends on where you live. It is also a bit too shiny in summer, when I don‚Äôt need as much hydration in my sunscreen.Finally, the smell. It‚Äôs not as noticeable as other Biossance products, but if you know you dislike it generally you may dislike this one too.

The cream consistency itself is quite thick, and it says the best way to apply it is to pat some gently onto cleansed skin, so I usually do this morning and night. In all honesty, I found it much more moisturizing than their Matte Lotion, however, I too have felt my face to be noticeably greasier by the end of the day, which from an expensive moisturizer, is not ideal. I was hoping this would be a middle ground between the Matte and the Cr√®me itself, but this definitely veers more towards the richness of the Cr√®me. I also tried using it just on a night but still found it too heavy and that it still doesn‚Äôt seem to sink in. On the plus side, it has brightened my skin and given it a radiant glow which wasn‚Äôt there before.

I‚Äôve used SK-II since I was in my teens, and since that time, generally have not felt a need to stray from the brand. However, they discontinued my go-to Derm Brightener moisturizer a couple of years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve experimented with a lot of different moisturizers and avoided purchasing this one because of the extremely high price point. Throughout my travels with a lot of the ‚Äútrendy‚Äú brands these days, such as Tatcha, Fresh, Biossance, Caudalie etc., I was still dissatisfied with my main moisturizer ‚Äî Tatcha especially left me scratching my head with the texture and the fact that it made me constantly break out. Biossance, I will admit, has moisturizers that ‚Äúfeel‚Äú nice, but don‚Äôt seem to actually improve my skin. After a year of breakouts, I caved and bought the Ultimate Revival cream. It looked like the closest SK-II product to the Derm Brightener albeit twice the price. And boy am I happy I made that choice! My skin started to get back to its glowing self within a few days. It‚Äôs chock full of ingredients like pitera/niacinamide/zinc gluconate. Despite it being ‚Äúgreasy‚Äú upon first application, what I‚Äôve noticed with the SK-II thick creams is that once your skin adapts to them after a couple of weeks, it loses that initial greasy feeling and instead sinks in and leaves it feeling soft and luxurious. I do have oily skin but this has not ever caused me to break out or become oilier. I only use this as a night cream due to its occlusive texture (the ingredients don‚Äôt seem to confirm that it is in fact an occlusive but it definitely has that texture, might be just a heavier emollient). And for the price, I‚Äôm not even halfway through the jar and it‚Äôs been four months since I purchased, so it‚Äôs turning out to be decent value. A little goes a long way for this moisturizer too.

A small amount of this product goes a long, long way, and being able to only use this a couple of times a month is all you need to do for the product to work its magic.If you have trouble with dry patches and finding makeup that works with your skin due to the dry patches, you likely need to add in an exfoliant to go along with your moisturizer. Exfoliation helps your skin absorb serums better, helps with cell turn over, and skin clarity. I use products that have chemical exfoliants, but this product really goes the extra step in removing the flakes and patches. I love my blemish reduction products but they do dry out your skin. This product helps complete my routine. Aging or dry skin would definitely benefit from this, but anyone can benefit really. I don‚Äôt find the smell strong, but if your super sensitive to perfumes in products, I would be mindful of that.', 'Best exfoliant yet.', NULL, 'brown', 'combination', 'red', 'P502640', 'Microdermabrasion Renewing Age-Defying Face Exfoliator', 'Dr. Brandt Skincare', 79),

Personally, this is not a downside, I just wish it was more honest in the description/sales pitch I got from an Sephora associate. After all, this is primarily a chemical, not physical exfoliant (though it feels a bit like one). In this sense, it can be a good transition product for people who are used to physical exfoliants but want to transition to using AHAs/BHAs, while still having a scrub experience. If you apply to clean, VERY dry skin, it works a lot better, and it did drastically reduce the dry skin I would have on my face over time. My pores were less obvious, and I liked using it on days before going out, so that makeup would apply more smoothly. The biggest downside in my experience was that it‚Äôs pretty intense, and I had to decrease my usage by a lot because it was drying out my skin too much (and ironically creating dry skin patches). I still like it and use it, and have even repurchased it, but if you have sensitive skin be careful because it can be too harsh or drying. Because it‚Äôs hard to use as often, I don‚Äôt see as many results anymore. However, in warmer/more humid seasons it‚Äôs a great, fun part of my routine.I definitely recommend to others, when used in moderation, if you want the fun of a physical scrub in chemical exfoliation, and if you‚Äôre not put off by the texture (pilling).

The metal tin is dense and solid quality. The product itself is lightweight, enough to be a day time cream and dries down quickly leaving little stickiness. There is a faint masking-scent apparent however it dissipates reasonably quickly. A couple things to note: this has an outer, reusable metal tin container and an inner plastic ‚Äúrefill‚Äù portion. The plastic refill portion has a solid plastic cap. You can either keep the cap on inside the metal tin or remove it. That being said the plastic cap tends to stick to the product inside so I found it easier to just keep the plastic tub open without the lid. I do find that even then residue ends up on the lip of the product resulting in the tub sticking to the metal lid which I have to gently pry off every so often. If you are going to travel with this you MUST keep the plastic lid on or it‚Äôll get messy really fast. Additionally, while I really like this formula I would warn you this is not a rich cream. If you have dry skin this will not lay thick (it‚Äôs very lightweight remember) and imo will moderately moisturize. It does a great job hydrating your outer dermis layers though. If you have dry or broken barrier this may not be your holy grail but for a day-to-day moisturizer I really enjoy it. Would definitely recommend if you have the money to splurge.

Firstly, this 1oz bottle is adorable, with minimalist aesthetic packaging, a cute baby-blueish liquid in a clear glass bottle, and a tiny dropper. But don‚Äôt let the size of this product fool you - it is effective with only 3-4 drops per day, so this bottle has lasted me for over a year! Additionally, this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and Clean at Sephora, which is quite impressive. I use this product daily after I shower, in between toner and moisturizer. I simply drop 3-4 drops in my hand, and then spread it around my face. It is very lightweight on the skin, and there‚Äôs no burning/sticky feeling that you can get with other serums.

But the true test was when a blotchy blemish showed up after a couple of days of vacation where I hadn‚Äôt taken Super Pure with me - when I returned, I just used the serum as usual, and within a couple of HOURS, the blemish was gone.So no, this serum isn‚Äôt the cheapest, but I would say that you need surprisingly little for it to work, and it works quite well.

After 5 months of use (on my 2nd bottle now), here is why it checks every single one of my boxes:1. Doesn‚Äôt make me break out. I had cystic adult acne for the past few years which is now mostly cleared up and has only continued to get better while using this product. I have even fallen asleep with it on many times, which would cause breakouts with every other sunscreen I‚Äôve used, but not this one.2. Doesn‚Äôt make me oily or dry. I have combination skin and this gives me the perfect dewy, glowy finish. If you have dry skin, you will adore the texture. If you prefer a matte finish, this isn‚Äôt it.3. Doesn‚Äôt weigh down my skin. Unlike most sunscreens that are a thick paste that you can feel just sitting on your face all day and can‚Äôt wait to take it off at night. This is so lightweight, it is like a silky water and I actually enjoy the way it feels on my skin.4. Doesn‚Äôt make my eyes burn at all. I have worn it swimming, working out, on the beach - and zero issues whatsoever5. No pilling. Every skincare and makeup product I have tried so far applies even better than normal when combined with this. 6. No white cast. The product itself is white, but immediately blends in and disappears once applied (I have light/medium olive skin tone)7. Little to no scent8. No silicone9. Beautiful packaging that dispenses the product cleanly and easily. Hasn‚Äôt leaked once and I‚Äôve flown with it multiple times (keep the little cap that comes on the pump!)10. Has noticeably improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin - more so than any other retinol, serum, or treatment I‚Äôve tried (much less an SPF!)

Hard to describe and something you can only appreciate once you‚Äôve tried it for yourself. Having said that, I believe it depends on the batch you get as there are natural variations in aroma, color and texture with each one. Mine was 1B02 which is printed in blue ink near the bottom of the bottle, on the glass itself. Also unlike other Rosehip oils I‚Äôve used in the past, this one doesn‚Äôt smell of anything unless I really put my nose up close and even then it‚Äôs very faint.  As for the benefits, I love the hydration I get from this and how it gradually fades acne marks. Love the simple fuss-free packaging and easy to use dropper that allows for a measured, precise dispensing of the oil. The only thing I don‚Äôt like, having a few TO products in rotation is that they all look identical at a glance and I‚Äôve often started to apply one before realizing it isn‚Äôt what I thought it was.

I got this form the outlet and it was way cheaper about $70 for the eye serum, this and the mini mask. This helps very minimally, and it works on water retention puffiness, not allergy puffiness or other types of inflammation. You‚Äôre going to first want to find your triggers, second sleep on elevated pillows, or a beauty pillow to reduce puffiness. Sleep is first regulate your sleeping schedule is number one, then reduce salt intake, look at diet, take diuretics on weekends, get active and move your body to drain the water. Next, start icing, ice your face and eyes and you will see a big change in the morning. Also try to do a face soak in ice cubes, cold water, and green tea leaves, then try a de puffing massage, also try do a warm compress with salt on eyes. If you still see minimal results, try RF machine once a week, or a facial tool like a roller, non Jade, the double knob silver roller that works really well. Also, take allergy pills if needed, dieuretics, once a week, zinc, and get enough pottasium, and eat less high glycemic foods. See a doctor if you think you have chronic edema or underlying conditions. If that fails, then try this. The eye serum is great. The mask is pretty expensive and didn‚Äôt last me more than three months. The eye serum doesn‚Äôt work for everyone though however it‚Äôs one of the few upper eyelid serums out there. Again as I said: - Facial massage - Icing face with ice/cold water - Find triggers and take allergy pills/vitamins - reduce salt intake and regulate sleep and get beauty pillow - Increase physical activity - See a doctor if all else fails', 'SKIP get the mask and eye serum instead', 'light', 'brown', 'combination', 'black', 'P446111', 'V Shaping Facial Lift Depuff & Contour Serum with Hyaluronic Acid', 'Clarins', 90),

If I go a little over board, my skin lets me know right away with a couple of small white heads.  I didn‚Äôt think it could get any better and have been pretty happy with my routine. But this spray took it to another level that I didn‚Äôt even know was possible. My skin lovessss it.  Not sure how to really explain it, my already normal plump skin looks even healthier and plumper in a good way.  I also use the hyaluronic dew drops right before the spray (received both as a gift with purchase btw) and it‚Äôs like a 1-2 punch.  Somehow it‚Äôs not overly moisturizing while being very effective in overall appearance and feel. I also use it as a setting spray after makeup because why not.

Meadow knotweed extract: This extract has a high concentration of resveratol, which is considered one of the strongest antioxidants, it is incredible for anti-aging due to its strong properties in stopping free radicals.3.) Triple lipid complex: This comes from the natural lipids in the cream which help against transepdiemral water loss, and fill in the natural fats in the epidermal layer.4.) Epidermal junction: The epidermal junction is between the epidermis and dermis and allows nutrients to pass from the bloodstream to our skin. As it degrades it becomes harder for our skin to be nourished and the bistorta root helps maintain this junction!5.) Marine plankton: This is also used for its antioxidant properties but also has a lot of minerals which help to preserve collagen and fight against free radicals that cause cause its degradation.I really do like this cream.

I‚Äôm 26 and haven‚Äôt had a real acne problem other than 1 pimple/month, 1 week before my period, so I can‚Äôt attest to the acne line. But this, and the moisturizer are my 2 fave products from this line so far. I‚Äôve tried to use prescription grade retinol, but it always makes my skin crazy sensitive and uncomfortable so I always just stop using it and don‚Äôt achieve any results lol this one doesn‚Äôt make my skin hurt but is also effective. I will say the texture is something to get used to, it‚Äôs kinda of goopy and thick, but I think maybe this was on purpose so the product really sticks to your skin and works for hours of repairing your skin. If you hate the texture too much, I‚Äôve mixed it with a facial oil and that turns it into a more traditional retinol cream, plus the added benefit of the moisture from the oil is a great addition to retinol that can sometimes be drying. I like to wait when Sephora has a sale, or once this whole line had a sale and that‚Äôs when I stock up because it is a tad pricey, but still I find that it is worth it if you are selective in your products and don‚Äôt own a million different things for each skincare category.

Their products are in nice pretty colorful glass bottles, luscious fruity scents and overall ingredients and brand formulations. This being said, I myself have bought many products from this brand like all their serums, dew drops and moisturizer and I do not regret those purchases. The last thing I personally was missing from this brand was their mist so naturally I bought it.      When I tell you the pictures are lying to your face. The actual size of the bottle is very small. I understand mists are very limited and compact in the skincare industry and its hard to find a good one you enjoy with actual product size. If you are thinking about this product I suggest finding it in store, smelling it and looking at its size if that‚Äôs something you want to spend $30 on. The box it comes in is also a little misleading because when you open it up, their is a major size difference.     Another reason I rated this product 2 stars is that it smelled lovely however, going off off appearance and aesthetics it looks NOTHING like the picture. The picture is very bubbly/cute/pink. In real life, the product is DIRT BROWN. Literally brown juice. Never in my life have I been more disappointed and cat-fished from a product.      PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look at it in store before purchasing. The smell is good just the actual look and size is not worth it. Lastly, not to be ‚Äúthat‚Äú person but I don‚Äôt even gravitate for this product regardless during my skincare because PERSONALLY putting on a watermelon candy scent after smearing on Chanel or Dior (luxury products in general ) on my face just isn‚Äôt it and ruins the vibes from a consumer perspective.

I realized this product is already new so there can‚Äôt be a change in the formula already... I thought it super odd. So, I went to sephora and asked the employees (who btw were clueless, dismissive and not helpful at all) so I decided to compare them myself (them as in the boxes on the shelf).. What I found after opening the boxes on the shelf, I found a variety of different serum concentrations!!! From one single deep orange (as the original one I bought that worked well) to light orange (watered down and smelled odd) to clear water!!!! YES CLEAR WATER! (SEE PHOTO IN MY REVIEW) one of the bottles had clear water in it instead of actual orange colored vitamin C serum! The saddest part is when I brought this to the attention of an employee they disregarded the matter and put the bottle right back on the shelf. So.. basically someone is going to buy that bottle and get ripped off because they will have just bought $75 worth of water.. anyways... great job sephora employees, quality work right there.

I do see a big difference from when I started BUT you do have to have a regimen of other products to get the better results. I did that with the help from an acne scar article I found. Daily:Salicylic acid face wash.Aha toner. Dscar 2x daily. Retinol. Silicone scar sheet for a few hours a day inbetween product use. Exfoliating scrub 2-3 times a week. Once a week:vitamin c peel. Microneedling about every 2 weeks. Adding all the extras in has made a big difference from how bad the scar was because it was decently big and deep to where I am now which is the missing skin is almost very close to being filled back in and very close to flush with my skin and closer to normal. I waited this whole time before posting this review. Does this product work? I believe it has helped some but once I found that acne scar article and introduced the other products in and had a sort of system going is when it got so much better with time and patience and a lot closer back to normal. I‚Äôm going to keep doing it my way and will soon be adding in the use of a neutrogena light therapy device because after looking into it the blue and red light therapy from that type of device also helps in reducing scarring.

I use this as a spot treatment for the parts of my skin that is oily only, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend replacing your regular toners with this product or using it on your entire face, It‚Äôs great in conjunction with other products since some will leave certain spots of my skin overly moisturized. I typically use moisturizer & serum before applying this pore solution and it doesn‚Äôt overly dry out my skin, It looks pretty great with primer layered over it if you have days that you don‚Äôt want to use foundation and want to go for a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù look. Its also very cooling upon application and I‚Äôve noticed that it tames some of the redness in the areas that it is applied too, Which I honestly didn‚Äôt expect! The scent is a bit light and fresh imo, I‚Äôd compare it to how most facial products smell so its not overly strong. As for the alcohol content - Its not as much as most products I‚Äôve used considering that this didn‚Äôt irritate my skin, I‚Äôd say its less than the Clinique toner which I use daily (which I could feel the alcohol content in that product). Bottom line : Overall I‚Äôd say get it considering the cost & quality of the product along with the fact that you don‚Äôt need that much of it for each use. I like this product especially since I was able to use an oil treatment on my dry patches for the first time in a long time, This product made up for the spots that are left oily or overly saturated from those types of nightly oil treatments as well as helpful for my day-to-day oil build up from working or physical activities that typically leave my face oily...
